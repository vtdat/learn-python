 # REST API
 #### 1.Denifition :
 -An API is an application programming interface. It is a set of rules that allow programs to talk to each other. The developer creates the API on the server and allows the client to talk to it.
 -REST determines how the API looks like. It stands for “Representational State Transfer”. It is a set of rules that developers follow when they create their API. 
One of these rules states that you should be able to get a piece of data (called a resource) when you link to a specific URL.Each URL is called a request while the data sent back to you is called a response.

 #### 2.The Anatomy Of A Request :
Request is made up of four things:
- **The endpoint** :
-- Endpoint (or route) is the url (Uniform Resource Locator) you request for. It follows this structure:
```sh
root-endpoint/? 
```
-- The root-endpoint is the starting point of the API you’re requesting from.
  Ex: The root-endpoint of Github’s API is https://api.github.com 
-- The path determines the resource you’re requesting for. You can access paths just like you can link to parts of a website.
 Ex:https://github.com/quynhvuongg/Image
https://github.com is the root-endpoint and /quynhvuongg/Image is the path.
-- The query parameters is final part of an endpoint . Technically, query parameters are not part of the REST architecture, but you’ll see lots of APIs use them.
Query parameters give you the option to modify your request with key-value pairs. They always begin with a question mark (?). Each parameter pair is then separated with an ampersand (&), like this: 
```sh
?query1=value1&query2=value2
```
Ex:https://github.com/quynhvuongg?tab=repositories
- **The  HTTP method** :
The method is the type of request you send to the server. You can choose from these five types below:  

| METHOD | DESCRIBE |
| ------ | ------ |
| GET (SELECT) | Returns a Resource or a Resource List|
| POST (CREATE) | Create a new Resource|
| PUT (UPDATE) | Updated information for Resource |
|DELETE (DELETE) | Delete a Resource |
- **The Header**
-- Headers are used to provide information to both the client and server. It can be used for many purposes, such as authentication and providing information about the body content.
-- HTTP Headers are property-value pairs that are separated by a colon(:).
You can send HTTP headers with curl through the -H or --header option:
    Ex: curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" https://api.github.com
(JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) a common format for sending and requesting data through a REST API. The response that Github sends back to you is also formatted as JSON.)
- **The data** (or body):
-- The data (sometimes called “body” or “message”) contains information you want to be sent to the server. This option is only used with POST, PUT, PATCH or DELETE requests.
-- To send data through cURL, you can use the -d or --data option:
curl -X POST <URL> -d property1=value1
-- To send multiple data fields, you can create multiple -d options:
curl -X POST <URL> -d property1=value1 -d property2=value2

#### 3.Authentication
- Basic Authentication:
With this method, the sender places a username:password into the request header. The username and password are encoded with Base64, which is an encoding technique that converts the username and password into a set of 64 characters to ensure safe transmission.
- Token Based Authentication :
Can be understood as “give access to the bearer of this token.” The bearer token allowing access to a certain resource or URL and most likely is a cryptic string, usually generated by the server in response to a login request.
- API Key Based Authentication:
In this method, a unique generated value is assigned to each first time user, signifying that the user is known. When the user attempts to re-enter the system, their unique key is used to prove that they’re the same user as before.
Many API keys are sent in the query string as part of the URL, which makes it easier to discover for someone who should not have access to it.A better option is to put the API key in the Authorization header.

#### 4.HTTP Status Codes And Error Messages:
200 OK - Successful return for methods GET, PUT, PATCH or DELETE.
201 Created - Returns when a Resouce has been successfully created.
204 No Content - Returns when Resource deleted successfully.
304 Not Modified - Client may use cached data.
400 Bad Request - Request is not valid.
401 Unauthorized - Request requires auth.
403 Forbidden - denied permission.
404 Not Found - Resource not found from URL.
405 Method Not Allowed - This method is not allowed on the current user.
410 Gone - Resource no longer exists, older version no longer supports.
415 Unsupported Media Type - Does not support this Resource type.
422 Unprocessable Entity - The data is not authenticated.
429 Too Many Requests - Request was rejected due to restrictions.
500+ means an error that originates from the server has occurred.
